                This cactus is a cute decorative scratcher that is incredibly easy to assemble.
                It has a little pom pom on an elastic string for play, and the arms of the cactus are plush and springy, so your cat may enjoy wrestling those as well. The 31" height is appropriate for most cats, although larger cats may find it to be a bit short for a good stretch. My 12lb cat still loves the cactus even though he'd probably appreciate 2-3 inches of height.

                This scratcher provides the extra height for larger cats. It is stable and durable and also very easy to assemble. The top of the pedestal doesn't serve much of a purpose. I wish there was a cat bed up there instead. I modified mine to have a platform on top, but it's not necessary. The footprint isn't too large, so it should fit in most room layouts. This scratcher will last longer than any sisal rope style as it won't fray as quickly.

                This is a very basic unattractive but inexpensive cardboard scratcher. This type of scratcher is easy to apply dry catnip to, but keep in mind it will trickle down through the cardboard and onto your carpet, so plan on vacuuming underneath it once in a while. It doesn't take up a lot of floor space, but it can be a bit of a trip hazard, so place it in a low traffic area that is still engaging with your room so the cat will use it. There are more attractive cardboard scratchers out there if you're concerned about appearances, but this will serve its purpose and is easy to replace.
