    <h1>Dollar Tree Finds</h1>
    <p>The Dollar Tree is successful because they offer a variety of daily use items at the simplified price point of only $1. Of course, not all of the items offered are a bargain, but they count on the consumer not considering each item too carefully. The convenience is irresistible, which is why I rarely leave without spending more than $10 (often closer to $30). 

    <h2>Here are some of my no-regret Dollar Tree Finds:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3><strong>Sun Best Fiber Boost Chocolate Brownie Bar</strong></h3>

            <blockquote>These brownies are surprisingly tasty rivaling Fiber One and other local health food brands. The value at this price point might not be great as you only get 3 bars at 0.85oz each, but as far as grocery items found at the Dollar Tree, this is one of my favorites.

        <li><h3><strong>Sun Best Fruit-Filled Biscuits</strong></h3></li>
        <br><img width=50% src="images/fruitbiscuits.jpg">
            <blockquote>These are unlike any snack I've had natively, but they are basically jam-filled crackers. They are sweet, but the cracker part is not overly sweet. It's a little less sweet-tasting than an animal cracker. The dry cracker and chewy jam filling are an interesting texture combination. I throw these in my lunch bag or eat them as a breakfast appetizer.</blockquote>
